# ITO-Web-Redesign

## Objectives (for now)

1. Decide on a Tech Stack (for now this project is front end exclusive)
* âœ“ React with TypeScript is what the group has agreed on
2. Start using Figma to Plan the new Site
* I don't want this entire semester to be us drawing a wireframe, so once we have one or 
two pages (landing page and one sub page) I want to get us coding as soon as possible because
that's why we're all here.
* link to our Figma is here: [ITO Web Redesign Figma](https://www.figma.com/team_invite/redeem/7QTOnuyyzsJQijOqYilRU2)
3. Break up work into by people/groups
* Web development is can be tricky to do collaboratively.
That being said, I would ideally like everyone to have their own page/component to work on
given that the team size is small enough to which that might be permittable. Once we start
getting into the nitty gritty of coding anyone is more than welcome to contribute however
they like though, I'm not here to make you do something you don't want to. 


# Getting Started

If you're completely new to Web Development or just need a quick refresher on how to get going, here's a quick guide to do so.

1. Install NPM and Node.js 
* These are package managers that are used to install and create React apps (they are also useful for many other applications)
* [Node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Use a 64 bit installation for whatever OS you are on
* to verify installation type `npm --version` in your Command Prompt

2. Clone our GitHub repo to wherever you want to store it 
* open Command Prompt
* cd to where you want to store the repo
* enter `git clone https://github.com/ColinKnudsen/ITO-Web-Redesign.git` 
* this will copy all of the remote file to your local machine

3. Navigate into the App inside the Repo Folder
* you can do this in Command Prompt or by opening the project in VSCode 
* either open a new terminal or in command prompt type `npm install` 
* this will download all the neccessary packages used in the project to your machine

4. Run the App
* If everything has gone successfully, you should be able to run `npm start` while in the project folder and a new tab should open with the app.


#### If for any reason a part of this has confused you or you need help, feel free to ask in discord and ping me (@pingu#0001 or Colin Knudsen) with a message. It's quite a handful if you're new so I have no problem helping anyone get set up for the first time!
